# TESSA
 A Java based voice assistant "test/prototype project" built with CMUSphinx and MaryTTS
 
 In an attempt to develop a personal voice assistant to improve upon project AVIA and AVII which where .NET Framework based voice assistants that used SAPI. Their speech recognition accuracy lacked in **all** noisey environments. This project was an attempt to explore other libiraries and methods of speech recognition and TTS without the use of the .NET Framework while also having cross platform capabilities. Java was an excellent choice as the compiled depedencies where included in the .jar file.

This project yielded interesting results and at times performed better than SAPI, it was limited in adding voice commands and sentence recognition compared to SAPI. Thus development ceased where dealing with .gram files to create sentence structures was not desireable.

This project has propelled me to learn neural networks further as they provide a solution that I needed which is to traverse a complex search space. This project was a beach head for project serena which at the moment is a private project under development that uses multiple machine learning networks that power this new voice assistant.

For those still interested in JAVA based voice assistants CMUSphinx and MaryTTS I hope this proves useful to you.
